Ref Finance is a multi purpose Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform on [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org).

Bringing together work of the community to provide decentralized exchange, lending and more financial functionality in the future.

Decentralized Finance has seen major growth on the platforms like Ethereum, benefitting from huge number of assets available there. Smart contracts allowed to create novel ways to manage assets which were unimaginable before.

At the same time, success of Ethereum is also bringing brought the platform to the state where only individuals and institutions with a lot of money can participate.

Something that is untithesis of Open Web and Decentralized Finance.

Ref Finance, together with other platforms on NEAR, is aiming to reverse this.

With fraction of cents fees, 1 second finality and ability to evolve faster due to better development environment on NEAR, Ref Finance is aiming to become the core DeFi component of the future.

Rainbow Bridge recently launched to connect NEAR and Ethereum will provide ability for users of Ethereum to come and participate in NEAR's economy.

Currently Ref Finance launching with just an automated market maker. The basis of it is very similar to Uniswap, with few changes:
 - Multiple pools are bundled in one contract. Single swap transaction can trade across many of them atomically.
 - Each pool can have it's own LP fees. Allowing LPs to customize pools for rare or highly volatile tokens
 - 1 bps goes to referrer of the swap transaction. This is done to incentivize UI runners and other applications using the Ref Finance

Additionally, Ref Finance community is planning to launch a DAO (using [Spuntik DAO](https://sputnik.fund)) to faciliate future development, upgrades and community building.

This DAO will be receiving 4bps of the swaps.

The plan for DAO to launch token that will allow to incentivize LPs, developers and users on the platform. More details on this will be in the subsequent posts.
