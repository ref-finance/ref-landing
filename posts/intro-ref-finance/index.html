Ref Finance is a multi purpose Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platform on NEAR Protocol.
Bringing together work of the community to provide decentralized exchange, lending and more financial functionality in the future.
Decentralized Finance has seen major growth on the platforms like Ethereum, benefitting from huge number of assets available there. Smart contracts allowed to create novel ways to manage assets which were unimaginable before.
At the same time, success of Ethereum is also bringing brought the platform to the state where only individuals and institutions with a lot of money can participate."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://ref.finance/posts/intro-ref-finance/><link href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.d85457619e67d31b97f40ed67c71b5efe0b52508ba759e5a9da0760afd6707db.css integrity="sha256-2FRXYZ5n0xuX9A7WfHG17+C1JQi6dZ5anaB2Cv1nB9s=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://ref.finance/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://ref.finance/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://ref.finance/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://ref.finance/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://ref.finance/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.82.0"><meta property="og:title" content="Intro to Ref Finance"><meta property="og:description" content="Checkout the app here
